vptree
======
The VP tree is particularly useful in dividing data in a [non-standard metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space#Examples_of_metric_spaces) into a
[BSP tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning).
Tree construction executes in O(n&nbsp;log(n)) time, and search is under certain circumstances and in the limit, O(log(n))
expected time. This makes it suitable when distance computations are expensive.
